# What's Markdown?

A lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext documents.

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

# Why Use Markdown?

- Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
  * Websites
    > Markdown was designed for the web, so it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content.
  * Documents
    > Markdown doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of word processors like Microsoft Word, but it’s good enough for creating basic documents like assignments and letters. You can use a Markdown document authoring application to create and export Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML file format. The PDF part is key, because once you have a PDF document, you can do anything with it — print it, email it, or upload it to a website.
    > Here are some Markdown document authoring applications I recommend:
      * Mac: MacDown, iA Writer, or Marked
      * iOS / Android: iA Writer
      * Windows: ghostwriter or Markdown Monster
      * Linux: ReText or ghostwriter
      * Web: Dillinger or StackEdit

  * Notes
    > In nearly every way, Markdown is the ideal syntax for taking notes. Sadly, Evernote and OneNote, two of the most popular note applications, don’t currently support Markdown. The good news is that several other note applications do support Markdown:
    * Simplenote, Notable, Bear, Boostnote, etc.
  * Books
    > Looking to self-publish a novel? Try **Leanpub**, a service that takes your Markdown-formatted files and turns them into an electronic book. Leanpub outputs your book in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI file format. 
  * Presentations
    > Believe it or not, you can generate presentations from Markdown-formatted files. Creating presentations in Markdown takes a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a lot faster and easier than using an application like PowerPoint or Keynote. 
	* [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/) [(GitHub project)](https://github.com/gnab/remark) is a popular browser-based Markdown slideshow tool, as is [Cleaver](https://jdan.github.io/cleaver/) [(GitHub project)](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver). 
	* If you use a Mac and would prefer to use an application, check out [Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/) or [Marked](https://marked2app.com/).
  * Email
    > [Markdown Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/markdown-here/) is a free and open-source browser extension that converts Markdown-formatted text into HTML that’s ready to send.
  * Documentation
   > Markdown is a natural fit for technical documentation. Companies like GitHub are increasingly switching to Markdown for their documentation — check out their blog post about how they migrated their Markdown-formatted documentation to [Jekyll](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/). If you write documentation for a product or service, take a look at these handy tools:
	*  [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) can generate a documentation website from your open source Markdown files. Just connect your GitHub repository to their service and push — Read the Docs does the rest. They also have a service for commercial entities.
	*  [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a fast and simple static site generator that’s geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown and configured with a single YAML configuration file. MkDocs has several built in themes, including a port of the Read the Docs documentation theme for use with MkDocs. One of the newest themes is MkDocs Material.
	*  [Docusaurus](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/docusaurus/) is a static site generator designed exclusively for creating documentation websites. It supports translations, search, and versioning.
	*  [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) is a static site generator powered by Vue and optimized for writing technical documentation.
	*  [Jekyll](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/) was mentioned earlier in the section on websites, but it’s also a good option for generating a documentation website from Markdown files. If you go this route, be sure to check out the Jekyll documentation theme.






  
- Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. (MS word와 같은 특정 app의 고유 파일 포맷이 아님.)

- Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.

- Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application.

- Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.

# How Does StackEdit Work?

The short answer is that you need a **Markdown application** capable of processing the Markdown file. There are lots of applications available — everything from simple scripts to desktop applications that look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences, all of the applications do the same thing. Like Dillinger, they all convert **Markdown-formatted text** to **HTML** so it can be displayed in web browsers.

To summarize, this is a four-part process:

1. Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
2. Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.
3. Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.
4. View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.


# Kicking The Tires

# Markdown with HTML&CSS

## Images

If you use markdown image load format **![Alt Text](**imageURL or Path**)**, this image will not center on the page. This will always show on the left side. You can use html change image align.

You can use **\<img>** to load image from url or path. Also set **width, height and align**.

### left alignment

<img align=”left” width=”100" height=”100" src=”http://www.fetchlogos.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superman-Logo.jpg">

### center alignment

<p align=”center”>

<img width=”200" height=”200" src=”http://www.fetchlogos.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superman-Logo.jpg">

</p>

### Collapse Sections

Collapsing large sections of text can make your plain text much easier to read.

<details>
<summary>”Click Here to expand”</summary>
this is hidden text block.
</details>

### Using CSS

Also you can use CSS stylesheet in your markdown plain text. You can do that two way. One of these is a write **`<style>`** in your markdown file and then use them in html tags.

<style>
.pclass{
background-color: yellow;
color: blue;
}
</style>
<p class=”pclass”>
Hello Markdown….
</p>
<button >
Markdown Button
</button>
